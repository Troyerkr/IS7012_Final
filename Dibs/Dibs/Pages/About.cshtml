            <p>
                Chris received his undergraduate degree from the University of Cincinnati in Business Analytics, where he also recieved his Master's in Business Analytics with a
                focus in Data Science. He was inspired by the method of colaboration he learned while he was in School, but felt that something was missing in interactions that were less face to face.
                He decided to join Dibs in order to help people connect in real human interactions that could help improve their productivity
